                <h2><b>REVIEW</b></h2>
                <b>Andy Carrascoza</b><em> February 7th, 2022</em>
                <p><em>The Breakfast Club</em> is one the best coming of age movies ever made. It is the quintessential 80s teen movie to watch. After wtahcing it for the first time I was grealty pleased seeing how serious the movie took itself even with the comedy that was sprinkled throughout. </p>

                <p>The movie was very interesting seeing the 5 teens learn more about each other and how they all have their own problems even though it may not seem like it from the outside. The group "therapy" session was a very powerful scene and led to one of my favorite parts of the movie with Brian asking what is going to happen on Monday at school, if they're going to keep friends or go back to ignoring each other because they don't fit in each others clicks. We never figure this question out but I like it how they left it to the viewe to interpret what would happen on Monday. </p>

                <h3><b>Trivia</b></h3>

                <ul>

                    <li>The scene in which all characters sit in a circle on the floor in the library and tell stories about why they were in detention was not scripted. Writer and director John Hughes told them all to ad-lib.</li>
                    <li>Judd Nelson improvised the part at the closing of the film where Bender raises his fist in defiance. He was supposed to just walk into the sunset, so to speak, and John Hughes asked him to play around with a few actions. When he was done and they were finishing up, Nelson threw his fist up without running it by anyone. Everyone loved it, and it has also become an iconic symbol of the 1980s as well as cinema history.</li>
                    <li>Bender's flinch when Vernon fakes a punch was genuine. Judd Nelson really thought Paul Gleason was going to hit him.</li>
