                    <p>I have <b>4 siblings</b>, 2 brothers and 2 sisters. I live in <i>Cranston, Rhode Island</i> and I drive to school everyday. I am currently working part time to help pay for college which is making my schedule pretty busy. In my spare time recently I have been watching a lot of movies and tv shows such as <em>Breaking Bad</em>.Also the Patriots are good again this year so I'm excited for the NFL Playoffs but the MLB is in a lockout and basketball is boring this year. (I wrote this during the first week of my html class and this last sentence is very outdated because the Patriots got bounced in the first round of the playoffs, baseball is back, and basketball is actually getting very good near the end of the season now.)</p>
