    <p>I have <b>4 siblings</b>, 2 brothers and 2 sisters. I live in <i>Cranston, Rhode Island</i> and I drive to school everyday. I am currently working part time to help pay for college which is making my shceudle pretty busy. In my spare time recently I have been wtahcing a lot of movies and tv shows such as <em>Breaking Bad</em>. Also the <strong>Patriots</strong> are good again this year so I'm excited for the <u>NFL Playoffs</u> but the MLB is in a lockout and basketball is boring this year.</p>
